# Getting Started

Catenda REST API v2 is the latest supported version and in this documentation we expose all the details on how to access these resources and what you can expect as return values.

This documentation assumes a basic knowledge of how REST APIs work. Visit this link if you need an introduction to this topic.

In case you have any questions or feedback, we would love to hear from you. Email us at support@catenda.com
