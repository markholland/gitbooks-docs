# Introduction

BCF is an open standard for managing issues on a BIM project. The BCF-API supports the exchange of BCF issues between software applications via a RESTful web interface, which means that data is exchanged via HTTP query parameters and JSON bodies. Every resource described in this API has a corresponding JSON schema (schema version draft-03). URL schemas in this README are relative to the BCF servers' base URL unless absolute values are provided.
